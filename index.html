        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I have been programming since I was 14 years old. Also, I designed my first website when I was 16 years old and since then I have gained a wealth of knowledge about designing and developing. This website is the first step to transform that
          knowledge into experience.</p>

        <h3>Reading & Memorizing</h3>
        <p>But the skill I most pride myself is in Memorizing and Reading. I read a lot and it is very difficult for me to forget the things I read or listen. So, don't be alarmed when I casually slip in a piece of conversation we had years ago.</p>
